This repository is a small tool in a much larger project â€”  
a custom game console that's still quietly in development.

While itâ€™s not ready for the spotlight, youâ€™re more than welcome  
to poke around and even use the source code â€” itâ€™s pretty handy.

Just know: this isnâ€™t the whole picture.

Stay tuned.
